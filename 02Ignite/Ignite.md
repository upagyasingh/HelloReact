## 1. What is `NPM` ?

- **NPM** is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and manage code dependencies in their projects.
- NPM is often mistakenly referred to as "Node Package Manager," but it doesn't actually have an official full form.
- NPM hosts the largest/standard repository of open-source packages, with millions of packages available for download. This extensive library provides developers with a vast array of tools, libraries, and frameworks to build and enhance their projects.

### Key Features:
- **Package Management**: Allows you to install and manage packages (libraries) that your project depends on.
- **Version Control**: Helps you keep track of versions of packages, ensuring compatibility and stability in your project.
- **Script Running**: NPM scripts can automate repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deploying.

### Initialize  a Node.js Project :
- `npm init` - to initialize a new Node.js project by creating a package.json file. 

## `package.json` 
- It is the configuration file for NPM .
-  It provides essential information about your Node.js project and helps manage the projectâ€™s dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

## `package-lock.json` 
- It keeps the track of the exact versions of all the dependencies installed.
- automatically generated by NPM when commands like `npm i` encountered.

## `package.json` vs `package-lock.json`

| Feature                         | `package.json`                                            | `package-lock.json`                                       |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | Configuration file for the Node.js project                | Dependency lock file for ensuring exact versions are used  |
| **Content**                     | Metadata, dependencies with version ranges, scripts       | Exact versions of dependencies, resolved URLs, integrity hashes |
| **Versioning**                  | Allows version ranges (e.g., `^4.17.1`)                   | Locks dependencies to exact versions                       |
| **Generation**                  | Manually created and maintained                          | Automatically generated by NPM                             |
| **Maintenance**                 | Updated manually when adding or modifying dependencies    | Updated automatically when dependencies are installed/updated |
| **Role in Dependency Management** | Lists dependencies with flexibility for minor updates   | Ensures consistency by locking dependencies to specific versions |
| **Version Control**             | Should be committed to version control                   | Should be committed to version control                     |
| **Flexibility**                 | Allows for flexibility with dependency versions          | Prioritizes stability by locking versions                  |
| **Reproducibility**             | Does not guarantee exact same versions across environments | Ensures exact same versions across all environments         |


## caret `^` vs tilde `~`


| Feature                  | Carat (`^`)                      | Tilde (`~`)                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Allows updates to newer minor and patch versions, but not major versions. | Allows updates to newer patch versions but not minor or major versions. |
| **Behavior**            | Updates to versions that do not change the major version. | Updates to versions that do not change the minor version. |
|**Use Case**            | Ideal for libraries where minor updates are expected to be compatible. | Ideal for libraries where only patch updates are acceptable to avoid unexpected changes. |

- **use caret in react.** 
## 2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

- A bundler is a tool that bundles our app, packages our app so
that it can be shipped to production.
- Minify our file (Remove console logs, bundle things up)
Examples of Bundlers:
- Webpack (`create-react-app`)
- Vite  
- Parcel
## What are dependencies or packages ?
- These are the actual distributions of code, including libraries or tools, that you install using a package manager. A package contains the code and metadata necessary to use it in your project.
-  Any package that is needed by your project to work is considered a dependency. The package manager handles these dependencies, resolving and installing them for you.
## Differences Between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`

| Feature                  | `dependencies`                             | `devDependencies`                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Packages required for the application to run in production. | Packages required only during development, not needed in production. |
| **Examples**             | - **React**: A library for building user interfaces. <br> - **Express**: A web framework for Node.js. | - **Webpack**: A module bundler for JavaScript. <br> - **Jest**: A testing framework for JavaScript. |
| **Installation Examples**         | `npm install react` | `npm install -D parcel` |

## 3. What are node_modules ? 
- Which gets installed is like a database for the npm.
- it has all the data releated to the dependencies needed.
- Every dependency in node_module will have its package.json.
- Node modules are very heavy so we should always put this in git ignore.

## Transitive dependencies

Transitive dependencies are dependencies that your project indirectly relies on through other dependencies. They are not listed directly in your `package.json`, but they are required for your project to work because they are dependencies of your direct dependencies.

eg :
- `react`  depends on `parcel`
- `parcel` depends on `babel` and `chalk`
- `chalk`  depends on `ansi-styles` and so-on...

ðŸ“¢ **no need to push node_modules to git/github as it can be regenerated by package.json and package-lock.json files by running command `npm i` because these files containes all the data releated to the respective dependencies**  

ðŸ“¢ put node_modules in `.gitignore`
