## 1. What is `NPM` ?

- **NPM** is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and manage code dependencies in their projects.
- NPM is often mistakenly referred to as "Node Package Manager," but it doesn't actually have an official full form.
- NPM hosts the largest/standard repository of open-source packages, with millions of packages available for download. This extensive library provides developers with a vast array of tools, libraries, and frameworks to build and enhance their projects.

### Key Features:
- **Package Management**: Allows you to install and manage packages (libraries) that your project depends on.
- **Version Control**: Helps you keep track of versions of packages, ensuring compatibility and stability in your project.
- **Script Running**: NPM scripts can automate repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deploying.

### Initialize  a Node.js Project :
- `npm init` - to initialize a new Node.js project by creating a package.json file. 

## `package.json` 
- It is the configuration file for NPM .
-  It provides essential information about your Node.js project and helps manage the projectâ€™s dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

## `package-lock.json` 
- It keeps the track of the exact versions of all the dependencies installed.
- automatically generated by NPM when commands like `npm i` encountered.

## `package.json` vs `package-lock.json`

| Feature                         | `package.json`                                            | `package-lock.json`                                       |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                     | Configuration file for the Node.js project                | Dependency lock file for ensuring exact versions are used  |
| **Content**                     | Metadata, dependencies with version ranges, scripts       | Exact versions of dependencies, resolved URLs, integrity hashes |
| **Versioning**                  | Allows version ranges (e.g., `^4.17.1`)                   | Locks dependencies to exact versions                       |
| **Generation**                  | Manually created and maintained                          | Automatically generated by NPM                             |
| **Maintenance**                 | Updated manually when adding or modifying dependencies    | Updated automatically when dependencies are installed/updated |
| **Role in Dependency Management** | Lists dependencies with flexibility for minor updates   | Ensures consistency by locking dependencies to specific versions |
| **Version Control**             | Should be committed to version control                   | Should be committed to version control                     |
| **Flexibility**                 | Allows for flexibility with dependency versions          | Prioritizes stability by locking versions                  |
| **Reproducibility**             | Does not guarantee exact same versions across environments | Ensures exact same versions across all environments         |


## caret `^` vs tilde `~`


| Feature                  | Carat (`^`)                      | Tilde (`~`)                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Allows updates to newer minor and patch versions, but not major versions. | Allows updates to newer patch versions but not minor or major versions. |
| **Behavior**            | Updates to versions that do not change the major version. | Updates to versions that do not change the minor version. |
|**Use Case**            | Ideal for libraries where minor updates are expected to be compatible. | Ideal for libraries where only patch updates are acceptable to avoid unexpected changes. |

- **use caret in react.** 
## 2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

- A bundler is a tool that bundles our app, packages our app so
that it can be shipped to production.
- Minify our file (Remove console logs, bundle things up)
Examples of Bundlers:
- Webpack (`create-react-app`)
- Vite  
- Parcel
## What are dependencies or packages ?
- These are the actual distributions of code, including libraries or tools, that you install using a package manager. A package contains the code and metadata necessary to use it in your project.
-  Any package that is needed by your project to work is considered a dependency. The package manager handles these dependencies, resolving and installing them for you.
## Differences Between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`

| Feature                  | `dependencies`                             | `devDependencies`                           |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Packages required for the application to run in production. | Packages required only during development, not needed in production. |
| **Examples**             | - **React**: A library for building user interfaces. <br> - **Express**: A web framework for Node.js. | - **Webpack**: A module bundler for JavaScript. <br> - **Jest**: A testing framework for JavaScript. |
| **Installation Examples**         | `npm install react` | `npm install -D parcel` |

## 3. What are node_modules ? 
- Which gets installed is like a database for the npm.
- it has all the data releated to the dependencies needed.
- Every dependency in node_module will have its package.json.
- Node modules are very heavy so we should always put this in git ignore.

## Transitive dependencies

Transitive dependencies are dependencies that your project indirectly relies on through other dependencies. They are not listed directly in your `package.json`, but they are required for your project to work because they are dependencies of your direct dependencies.

eg :
- `react`  depends on `parcel`
- `parcel` depends on `babel` and `chalk`
- `chalk`  depends on `ansi-styles` and so-on...

ðŸ“¢ **no need to push node_modules to git/github as it can be regenerated by package.json and package-lock.json files by running command `npm i` because these files containes all the data related to the respective dependencies**  

ðŸ“¢ put node_modules in `.gitignore`

## What is `.parcel-cache` ?

- Parcel caches code all the time.
- When we run the application, a build is created which takes some time in ms.
- If we make any code changes and save the application, another build will be triggered which might take even less time than the previous build.
- This reduction of time is due to parcel cache.
- Parcel immediately loads the code from the cache every time there is a subsequent build.
- On the very first build parcel creates a folder .parcelcache where it stores the caches in binary codeformat.
- Parcel gives faster build, faster developer experience because of caching.

## 4. What are the different types of Script types ?

### `type="module"`

**Description:** This type is used for JavaScript modules, which are scripts that can import and export functions, objects, or values. Modules are executed in strict mode by default and have their own scope, separate from the global scope.

| Script Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type="text/javascript"`            | Default type for JavaScript. Modern HTML assumes this type when omitted.                                                                                             |
| `type="application/json"`           | Used for embedding JSON data. The content is not executed but can be accessed via JavaScript.                                                                        |
| `type="text/template"`              | Embeds client-side templates that are not executed immediately but can be used later by JavaScript.                                                                  |
| `type="text/x-handlebars-template"` | Specifically for Handlebars.js templates, allowing dynamic content rendering.                                                                                        |
| `type="text/babel"`                 | Used with Babel to enable next-generation JavaScript features. Scripts with this type are compiled by Babel before being executed.                                   |
| `type="application/ld+json"`        | Embeds structured data in JSON-LD format, often for search engine metadata like schema.org data.                                                                     |
| `type="text/coffeescript"`          | Embeds CoffeeScript, a language that compiles into JavaScript. Requires a CoffeeScript compiler.                                                                      |
| `type="text/css"`                   | Although CSS is usually within `<style>` tags, this type can be used for inline styles or style-related scripts (uncommon).                                          |
| Custom Types (e.g., `type="text/custom"`) | Used to store custom data or content that can be accessed and manipulated later by JavaScript. The content is not executed or processed by the browser.             |
